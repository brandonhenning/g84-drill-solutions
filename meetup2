2-28-18 Learn to Code Colorado

I attended the Learn to Code Colorado meetup on Wednesday night. I was expecting to not learn a whole lot but maybe be able to help other students at the breakouts focused on HTML, CSS, or Javascript. However, I ended up learning a ton! I went with the JS group breakout and started working on the final project which is a simple Mad Libs app running in the browser. I thought I would be able to quickly crank out the app using jQuery but I was rapidly made aware of the lack of jQuery mastery in my possession. 

Brevon from G84 helped me build the simple Madlibs app with a bunch of Googling on my part we managed to build it in about an hour. I also got to meet a few people who attended who were working on their own startup or were considering attending Galvanize’s full program. Overall I really enjoyed the experience and plan  on helping to TA in the future because the environment was awesome. 

The questions I have after attending are : 
How can I better help support other students in the future
Is jQuery still used by anyone? Lol it is really not the best. Feels like tech from the 90’s, very unintuitive in my opinion. Still felt good to get a small handle on how to use it. 
Are there other meetups around Denver like this but for programming languages I don’t understand? 

I met an entrepreneur named Tyler who was working on learning to code so he could build his own app. 
Also met a student from G77 who was helping TA the class and it was cool to hear his perspective on the program.
