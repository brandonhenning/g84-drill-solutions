3-7-18 Trading Algorithm Development Meetup

I attended the Trading Algorithm Development club meetup. I’m really passionate about this topic because I worked in finance before Galvanize and developed trading algorithms on my own time to trade different asset classes. I was expecting to meet some other people interested in trading algo development as well. 

The event was hosted by Quantopian which is a crowd-sourcing algo platform that allows people to develop algorithms to trade different asset classes. 

I was honestly pretty far out of my depth during the presentation. The presenter moved pretty fast through the algorithm he developed and all the code was in Python. I have some very basic knowledge in python but the level of python being used was pretty advanced. I found my eyes glazing over during sections of the presentation because it was all chinese to me. Still overall I’m interested in continuing to attend these meetups and become more involved in the group. This also made me want to learn Python to at least a working level for algo development. 

The questions I have after attending are : 
How can I best learn Python to develop algos?
Are there other people in the Denver area who maybe would like to host further algo trading meetups or maybe I could organize them
 Can I use my knowledge of JS to help aid me in my discovery of good trading algo development approaches? Will start thinking about this...

Max Margenot- Max was the presenter , he works at Quantopian and heads their tech team there. He gave some good book ideas to getting started in algo development.

Paige Murphy- Paige also works at Quantopian and organized this event.
