Learning Vue Framework- to easily make cool web apps 
2-26-2018
Set the Stage
I set the stage in a simple but super effective way for myself. I can get distracted easily during presentations if my computer is on and open. I can catch myself working on something else unrelated to the topic and basically not have learned a single thing by the time the presentation is over. Therefore, my powerful yet simple setting the stage is me closing my laptop and giving my full attention to the presentation. 
Reflection
I really learned alot from CJ’s breakout titled “Intro to Vue.” The pace was great and he walked us through the process of installing Vue using npm and then building a simple single page app. He also covered the benefits of using a front-end framework in general like delegating coding tasks to the framework so you don’t have to code every single piece of the program every time you want to build a web app. 
 
The ‘Play’ part for me was following along with CJ as he built a simple app that talked to ombd.com API and returned a set of posters for each movie that matched the search term and then rendered it on the screen to the user. I really want to try to build a very similar type of app as a practice to learn Vue frameworks. I was really not able to get a complete setup going besides launching the Vue basic app. I would love to follow up more this week and get that first Vue app going by taking a patient approach and loving to learn as I go. I am excited for the challenge!
