Vue Meetup Notes - 2-26-18


The reflection includes all of the following:
	•	The name and date of the meetup
	•	The name and job information of at least 2 people you met
	•	A 1-2 paragraph description of what you learned at the meetup
	•	1-3 questions that you have after attending the meetup


Vue meet up was on Monday evening 2-26-18. 

I met Zach and Alex from wyyred.com and Yuki from Home-Advisor. They were all great and talked about the type of developers they are looking for. 

		I learned a ton at the meet up including a lot about Vue. CJ did a walkthrough of the advantages of using Vue over Angulur or React. The main benefits that interested me were the simplicity of getting started vs Angulur, the rising popularity of the framework, as well as the fact that the project is open source. I learned how to set up Vue on my local machine using npm and deploy it to the browser. I need much more practice but am looking forward to getting into it. 

		Another thing I learned was what a real developer does. I spend a lot of time talking to a couple developers from wyyred.com which is a telecom startup. One of the gentleman was the former head of security at Twitter and had quit to cofound this startup. It was fun hearing about the software they are building and the things they need. I definitely plan on keeping in touch with the developers I met. 

The questions I have after the meet up are :: 

What are the downsides to using Vue if any? 
Can I build a simple web app using Vue with the JS knowledge that I currently have.
What kind of Vue skills are the most in demand
