Get assigned extra JS stuff to work on
Finish basic HTML/CSS website stuff, probably will work on that most of the day
Maybe do a little CodeWars Katas and keep the JS shit sharp

Reflection
The following questions are answered in writing:
 Were the goals met? 


For the most part yes. I talked to instructors about additional JS work. I finished most of the 2nd website design work but still need some more CSS practice. Also did some CodeWars stuff. 


 What went well? 
	
	HTML and CSS is going a bit better. I was glad I found out a bit more about the curriculum. Iâ€™m feeling rusty on JS stuff on Codewars though. Maybe I need to focus on those to stay sharp in JS.


 What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met.

Feel like HTML and CSS are harder than I anticipated. I need to not ignore those weaknesses in my skills and instead concentrate my efforts in that area. 


 What will you do differently tomorrow?

Need to attend a breakout on CSS and also keep doing Katas everyday to not get rusty in JS.
