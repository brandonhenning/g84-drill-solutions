Reflection
The following questions are answered in writing:
 Were the goals met? 


Not really, I was able to complete the second HTML page, work with classmates, and to resubmit most of the modules that got kicked back to me. I also learned a ton about Vue in a breakout taught by CJ. Did not quite get to the Katas the way I was hoping. Also did not quite get to the learn to learn module. 


 What went well? 
	
	Felt like I really learned alot today. Before today I didn’t really know anything about front-end frameworks. Now I have a solid idea of how I will build some simple web apps with Vue. Didn’t quite get to everything I wanted to today but overall felt productive. Think I need some more JS practice every day so as not to get rusty. 


 What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met.

Again just felt like I didn’t quite get everything done that I wanted to. Really want to crush all of module 1 before the end of the week and for that need to get HTML/CSS dialed in. Definitely felt better with CSS after some practice. 


 What will you do differently tomorrow?

Maybe start a bit earlier and try to really stay focused throughout the day and keep starting with a daily plan and weekly plan of what I want to get done throughout the week.
