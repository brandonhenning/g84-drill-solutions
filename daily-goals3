Reflection
The following questions are answered in writing:
 Were the goals met? 


Not really, I was able to complete the second HTML page, work with classmates, and to resubmit most of the modules that got kicked back to me. I also learned a ton about Vue in a breakout taught by CJ. Did not quite get to the Katas the way I was hoping. Also did not quite get to the learn to learn module. 


 What went well? 
	
	Felt like I really learned alot today. Before today I didn’t really know anything about front-end frameworks. Now I have a solid idea of how I will build some simple web apps with Vue. Didn’t quite get to everything I wanted to today but overall felt productive. Think I need some more JS practice every day so as not to get rusty.
