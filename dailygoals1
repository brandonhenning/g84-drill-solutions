Reflection
The following questions are answered in writing:
 Were the goals met? 


Yes, I was very happy to get the JS stuff done, still working on the html css stuff but have a good grasp on it now starting from scratch. 


 What went well? 
	
	The JS stuff I was totally stumped on yesterday, really was feeling frustrated. Came back fresh this morning and quickly got a little momentum and was able to work through them all. 
  Felt great! Also decided to start from scratch on the basic website and build it myself instead of using Bootstrap. Harder but I need the practice so Iâ€™m enjoying it. 


 What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met.

Pretty much everything went well for me today I felt :). Super productive day!


 What will you do differently tomorrow?

Definitely need to come in with a fresh energy each day. I got burned out yesterday by never taking a break. Will definitely pace myself in the future.
